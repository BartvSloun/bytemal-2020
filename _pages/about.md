(taken from older website. still needs updating)

byteMAL (Bioinformatics for Young inTernational researchers) is a conference for young researchers in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology and aims to provide a new networking platform for knowledge and expertise exchange across borders.

As researchers of very related topics in neighboring regions we are excited to widen our perspectives by creating the opportunity to discuss methods, tools, challenges and successes with people of similar mindset.

To vitalize the communication amongst researchers from the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, there will be three independent conferences held in Maastricht, Aachen and Liège.

The conference is a cross-border endeavour to vitalize the communication amongst researchers from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Therefore, the conference has been hosted alternately by the Universities of Maastricht, Aachen and Liege over the last 4 years. For the 5th anniversary event, ByteMAL will return to Maastricht, where we intend to build on its record of success.

The conferences are especially aimed at young researchers – master students, PhD students, and Post-docs. It will give participants the opportunity to learn top-notch research from experienced professors in the same field, present their current work on posters, and discuss their own developed tools and approaches with each other.
